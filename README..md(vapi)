# 🚦 RushResQ — vapi branch
**Hackathon branch:** `vapi`
This branch is a from-scratch scaffold (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind) demonstrating a minimalist frontend dashboard and an API placeholder for RushResQ (AI + IoT traffic management).

## What this branch shows
- Clean frontend scaffold for judges to preview UI quickly.
- `src/config.ts` contains `API_BASE` — plug in the backend URL to connect.
- Small UI components under `src/components/`.
